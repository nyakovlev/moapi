Welcome, CV CyberPatriot teams! This repository is aimed at establishing a home for Ubuntu/Debian scripting.

Scripting is an extremely powerful method for accomplishing the various security tasks of a typical CyberPatriot round. Over the years, a number of students have developed nifty tools to help you knock out vulnerabilities, but documentation for such tools is often quite scarce, and as a result, many individuals shy away from the power of code. This repository is focused towards closing the coding gap between separate CyberPatriot seasons; however, this is a process, and it has yet to be completed. You must be daring and ready to complete tasks and follow instructions on your own. You must be prepared to copy and paste cryptic error messages into Google and experiment with doubtful but hopeful solutions. You must be willing to take independent initiative and decide how YOU want to own this season.

You can also ask Pauley for help - while an independent drive is vital, we're still here for guidance.

While scripting is a challenging skill to learn, it is forever a developing skill, and it is well worth your time and effort.

# Installation Instructions
* Step 0: Make sure you have Ubuntu running somewhere.
* Step 1: Open a terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/nyakovlev/moapi.git`. If it says that the git command isn't recognized, you'll need to install it with `sudo apt-get install git`.
* Step 2: Enter the directory you just cloned by typing `cd KeepMe`.
* Step 3: Type `sudo ./install.sh`. This ensures that various dependencies, like Python3.6, websockets, pygame, and Google Chrome are runing on the system.
* Step 4: You're ready to go! To verify functionality of the installation, type `sudo ./scoring_engine.py` or double-click the newly-created **Scoring Engine** icon on your desktop.
# Using MoaPI
# Custom Vulnerabilities
Are you considering adding or completing vulnerabilites to the engine? Are you simply interested in building secret proprietary vulnerabilities for your team alone to use? In either case, we're glad to have you aboard the MoaPI development team!
Inside `scoring/data`, you'll find all the files used to create the vulnerabilities
## Creating a New Vulnerability
## Editing/Completing Existing Vulnerabilities
MoaPI contains a great number of potential vulnerabilties, but they have yet to be functional. You can find documentation for programming these vulnerabilities in the <a href='http://bookofzeus.com/harden-ubuntu/'>Book of Zeus</a> and/or the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/15on6nqADnFPpG7BkF9hpiQgpI0dTQmIP/view?usp=sharing'>CIS Ubuntu Security Benchmark</a>.
# Proposing Changes

---
That should be all! It is now up to you to decide how to use these tools to best prepare your team for the heat of the competition. Questions or concerns can be made to Pauley.

Best wishes!
