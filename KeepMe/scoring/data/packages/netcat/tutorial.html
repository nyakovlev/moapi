<h3>
  Removing Netcat
</h3>
<p>
  Installing various packages can make your system vulnerable to any known or discovered security issues in the software. Hackers trying to gain access to your machine often can take advantage of such security holes in your system's software. For this reason, it is highly recommended to purge anything on your machine that is not required to be there.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Netcat is a utility that allows the reading and writing of TCP and UDP packets. It can be used to create network backdoors in the system, and it should be removed. (When removing netcat, do check the system for any netcat backdoors)
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To check if netcat is installed on your system, you can type <span class="code_txt">dpkg -l | grep netcat</span>. (the <b>grep</b> command is to find packages with names containing "netcat")
</p>
<br>
<p>
  If results come up, then some version of netcat is likely installed. To remove apache, purge the results that return from the above command. (For example: <span class="code_txt">sudo apt-get purge netcat netcat-traditional netcat-openbsd</span>)
</p>
<br>
<p>
  That should be it!
