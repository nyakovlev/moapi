  Installing various packages can make your system vulnerable to any known or discovered security issues in the software. Hackers trying to gain access to your machine often can take advantage of such security holes in your system's software. For this reason, it is highly recommended to purge anything on your machine that is not required to be there.
</p>

<p>
  RSH Client is a legacy version of SSH. It contains numerous vulnerabilities, and both the client and server should be removed. In this particular vulnerability, we are removing the client. (this prevents users from accidentally using this command and exposing their credentials through it)
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To check if RSH client is installed on your system, you can type <span class="code_txt">dpkg -l rsh-client</span>, then <span class="code_txt">dpkg -l rsh-redone-client</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  If the name of either package is preceded by "<b>ii</b>", then it is installed. To remove it, simply type <span class="code_txt">sudo apt-get purge ldap-utils</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  That should be it!
