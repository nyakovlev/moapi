<h3>
  Removing SSH Server
</h3>
<p>
  Installing various packages can make your system vulnerable to any known or discovered security issues in the software. Hackers trying to gain access to your machine often can take advantage of such security holes in your system's software. For this reason, it is highly recommended to purge anything on your machine that is not required to be there.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  SSH Server allows users to connect to the machine over the connected network and use a command line, in the same way that they would use a terminal on the machine itself. If not specifically required by the README, this functionality should not be made available.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To check if an SSH server is installed on your system, you can type <span class="code_txt">dpkg -l openssh-server</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  If the name of the package is preceded by "<b>ii</b>", then it is installed. To remove it, simply type <span class="code_txt">sudo apt-get purge openssh-server</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  That should be it!
