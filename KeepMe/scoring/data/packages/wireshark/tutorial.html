<h3>
  Removing Wireshark
</h3>
<p>
  Installing various packages can make your system vulnerable to any known or discovered security issues in the software. Hackers trying to gain access to your machine often can take advantage of such security holes in your system's software. For this reason, it is highly recommended to purge anything on your machine that is not required to be there.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Wireshark is a utility used to analyze network packets. It is quite useful for debugging complex network issues, but it can pose a network security risk if not absolutely needed on the system.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To check if Wireshark is installed on your system, you can type <span class="code_txt">dpkg -l | grep wireshark</span>. (the <b>grep</b> command is to find packages with names containing "wireshark")
</p>
<br>
<p>
  If results come up, then Wireshark is likely installed. To remove it, purge the results that return from the above command. (For example: <span class="code_txt">sudo apt-get purge wireshark wireshark-common wireshark-qt libwireshark8 libwireshark-data</span>)
</p>
<br>
<p>
  That should be it!
