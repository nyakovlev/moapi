  Installing various packages can make your system vulnerable to any known or discovered security issues in the software. Hackers trying to gain access to your machine often can take advantage of such security holes in your system's software. For this reason, it is highly recommended to purge anything on your machine that is not required to be there.

<p>
  LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) client is typically used to look up information from a central database (an LDAP server). If it isn't specifically required in the README, it should be removed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To check if LDAP client is installed on your system, you can type <span class="code_txt">dpkg -l ldap-utils</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  If the name of the package is preceded by "<b>ii</b>", then it is installed. To remove it, simply type <span class="code_txt">sudo apt-get purge ldap-utils</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  That should be it!
