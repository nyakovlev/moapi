  auditd allows system administrators to observe activities going on throughout the day and monitor changes in their systems, such as unauthorized access or modification of data. It is recommended for a secured system to have a logging service (rsyslog) along with a properly configured auditing service.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  To install auditd, simply type <span class="code_txt">sudo apt-get install auditd</span>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  That should be it! Further tasks involving auditd configuration are covered in other vulnerability checks.
